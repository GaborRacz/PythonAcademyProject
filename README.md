Finance:
The training is completely self-financed by the students; the program is not associated with any international exchange programs. The Chinese institutions could support the students as well. The Hungarian institutes would establish a contract with the Chines sending institutes, not the students, thus the Chinese university would take responsibility for the financial transactions. Participation in the Hungarian education system is only a viable option to Chinese students, if the prices are competitive with the US and Western offers.
